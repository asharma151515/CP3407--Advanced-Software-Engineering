# cp3407-project-v2025 (MyClean App)

## Topic
A Booking and Management Platform for Cleaning Services

## Project Overview
Our team is developing a web-based application called **Scrubhub** a modern
and user-friendly cleaning service platform designed to connect customers
with cleaners efficiently. This platform not only simplifies the booking 
process but also empowers customers to choose cleaners based on language preferences,
such as Chinese-speaking cleaners, to address potential communication barriers. 
The application will feature real-time availability, cleaner profiles, secure bookings,
and feedback systems to improve transparency and trust.

## Purpose
The purpose of the MyClean website is to provide a simple and efficient platform for users to book home cleaning services,
with the unique option to select cleaners based on language preferences to overcome communication barriers.

## Goals
- Secure email/password registration and login  
- Browse and book cleaning services  
- Booking reminders and post-service ratings
