## 1️⃣ Velocity Table

| Feature/Task                | Estimation (days) | Status                       | Days Counted/Worked |
|-----------------------------|-------------------|------------------------------|----------------------|
| Booking Reschedule/Cancel   | 5.0               | ✅ Done                      | 4.0                  |
| Email Confirmation          | 3.0               | ✅ Done                      | 3.0                  |
| Cleaner Availability Mgmt   | 3.0               | ✅ Done                      | 3.0                  |

**🟢 Total Velocity (Completed Work): 14.5 days**

> **Note:** For partially completed tasks, only the portion completed within the sprint is counted toward velocity.


## 📊 Velocity Calculation
Velocity = Sum of effort (days) completed within the sprint

     = 4.0 + 3.0 + 3.0 + 3.0 + 1.5 + 0.0

     = **14.5 days**

|------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------|
| 0          | 15                            | 15                           |

### 🧠 How to Interpret the Chart

- **Planned Line**: A smooth, steady decline assuming ideal progress.
- **Actual Line**: Shows real team performance. Some tasks took longer or remained incomplete.
- The final value (**3.5 days**) reflects **carryover work** to the next sprint.
- **Gaps between lines** highlight where work didn't align with estimates — useful for sprint retrospectives and improving future planning.

---

## ✅ Summary

- **Total work completed**: `14.5 days` out of `15 planned`
- **Velocity** for this iteration = **14.5**
- **Remaining work** (carryover) = **3.5 days**
- Will used this data in your next **retrospective** to discuss:
  - Estimation accuracy
  - Partial task delays
  - How to better distribute work across the team
