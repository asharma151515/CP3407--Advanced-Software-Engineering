## 2. INVEST & MoSCoW Criteria

- **INVEST (p. 39)**:  
  - **Independent**: Each user story stands alone.  
  - **Negotiable**: Stories can be split or merged.  
  - **Valuable**: Each story delivers clear user or business value.  
  - **Estimable**: Effort can be estimated in days.  
  - **Small**: Fits within a single iteration (≤ 5 days).  
  - **Testable**: Acceptance criteria are clear or implied.  

- **MoSCoW Prioritization**:  
  - **Must-have**: Critical for MVP.  
  - **Should-have**: Important but can slip to later.  
  - **Could-have**: Optional; can be dropped if necessary.  
  - **Won’t-have**: Out of scope for this release.

## 3. Full Backlog Summary

See `initial_backlog_ideas.md` for the full list of 14 user stories.  
**Summary Totals:**  
- Must-have (Stories 1–5): **19 days**  
- Should-have (Stories 6–8): **7 days**  
- Could-have/Won’t-have: **20 days**  

Combined Must + Should = **26 days**, which fits within the first two iterations.
