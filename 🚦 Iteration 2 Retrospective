# 🔄 Iteration 2 Retrospective – Team SCRUBHUB

---

## 🔍 What Went Well

- ✅ **High Completion Rate:** Team completed 14.5 days of planned 15 days — 97% of sprint goal achieved.
- 🔄 **Consistent Progress:** Most features were finished; only minor carryover work remains.
- 🤝 **Team Collaboration:** Task assignments were balanced, and work was shared effectively across team members.
- 📢 **Transparency:** The burndown chart and daily standups made our progress and blockers visible to all.

---

## 🏔️ What Didn’t Go So Well

- 📉 **Estimation Issues:** Partial completion on some features (e.g., “Admin APIs”, “Booking Reschedule/Cancel”) led to unfinished work and slight underestimation.
- ⏳ **Carryover Work:** 3.5 days of tasks remain and need to be accounted for in the next iteration.
- ⚠️ **Partial Task Delays:** Some tasks had hidden complexity or dependencies that weren’t obvious at planning time.
- 🔁 **Team Member Utilization:** Some developers finished earlier or had less to do; a few tasks may have been bottlenecks.

## 📊 Data Recap

| Metric                   | Value     |
|--------------------------|-----------|
| Planned Work             | 15 days   |
| Completed Work (Velocity)| 14.5 days |
| Remaining/Carryover      | 3.5 days  |

### 📉 Burndown Takeaway:
Our actual line finished **above** the ideal line, meaning planned velocity was slightly higher than actual delivery — mainly due to **task slippage** and **partial completions**.

---

## 🛠️ What to Improve Next Iteration

- ✅ **More Granular Task Breakdown:**  
  Split user stories/tasks more thoroughly during sprint planning to avoid partial completions.

- 🎯 **Refine Estimation Process:**  
  Discuss past actuals and task complexity surprises during planning and adjust accordingly.

- 📌 **Address Carryover Quickly:**  
  Surface remaining work immediately in Iteration 3 planning to avoid delays.

- 🔄 **Even Out Work Distribution:**  
  Watch for bottlenecks — ensure no developer is blocked or underloaded. Pair up on larger/complex tasks earlier.

---

## 🏆 Team Commitments

- Commit to **improved estimation realism**.
- Carry over **incomplete work as first priority** in Iteration 3.
- Review **why tasks became partial** — identify hidden blockers or misalignments.
- Visualize workflow daily using the **project board**.
- Use standups to **unblock teammates quickly**.
